# From humble beginnings
Myonic is a medical technology startup from Boulder, Colorado. The Myonic Move device technology originally started as a high school science project by Nick Titus. After receiving third place, he decided that he wanted to change direction. He saw the technology's potential to help people and wanted a way to make it publicly accessible. He decided to start Myonic Technologies. Within a few weeks he applied to the Boomtown Accelerator in Boulder, Colorado. Myonic Technologies was accepted to the summer program and became the youngest group to attend the accelerator at age 17.

Nick brought long-time friends Nate Petersen, Sam Everett, and Ben Saltz on as co-founders. Nate Petersen because he had years of experience of IT and computational technology and science, Sam Everett because of his business and finance knowledge, and Ben Saltz because of his experience in graphic design and product design.

All four attended Centaurus High School in Lafayette, Colorado and had taken multiple courses from its engineering program. Nick developed the technology through the Design Technology course and utilized the resources provided through the engineering lab at the school to create the first rough prototype of the Move.

Myonic is currently developing the Move technology into a manufacturable product. The Move will be affordable and available to general consumers instead of being distributed by insurance. Check out our social media and don't hesitate to send us a message!
